**HandTracking Car Game**

**Description**

The HandTracking Car Game is an innovative project that leverages Python, computer vision, and MediaPipe to create an engaging gaming experience. 
In this game, the car's position is controlled by the player's hand movements, which are tracked in real-time using machine learning concepts.
The objective of the game is to navigate the car without colliding with obstacles.

**Features**

Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe.
Control the car's movements with your hand gestures.
Avoid obstacles to keep the car moving and score points.
Engaging and interactive gameplay experience.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language for the project.

OpenCV: For computer vision tasks and image processing.

MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.

Machine Learning: Underlying technology for hand tracking and gesture control.
